    So I'm going to strart writing a story entitled <b>It does pays to be polite .</b>

<h1><u>IT DOES PAYS TO BE POLITE.</u></h1>
</head></p>
<body>
    How old should one be before he/she begins to be polite? 10 would you say? Or 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 or 4? Well,Dick learned to be polite when he was very, very young. From the time he learned
    how to talk, his mother taught him to say 'Please', 'Thank you', and'Excuse me' and 'I'm sorry' and 'You're welcome'- and other words which help such a lot to make life pleasant.
    <p>One day when Dick was not quite 5 years old, he got on a bus with his mother. He was ahead, with hi mother following, as they walk down the aisle looking for a seat. The bus moved forward
    with a sudden jerk and Dick stumbled. As he did so, he stepped on a man's foot. THe man pulled his foot away and looked upset. "I'm sorry Sir," said Dick. "I'm very sorry I didn't mean to"
    The man smiled. So did all the passengers. Everybody was suprised-and pleased- to hear a little boy speak so politetly.Smiling at his mother, the stranger began to ask some questions.</p>
    <p>"What's your name?"</p>
    <p>"Dick Gentry, Sir"</p>
    <p>"How old are you?"</p>
    <p>"Four-but I'll soon be 5"</p>
    <p>"When's your birthday?"</p>
    <p>Dick told him.</p>
    <p>"Where do you live?"</p>
    <p>Dick gave the man his address.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile all the people on the bus were watching and listening. There was a smile on every face because one little boy was so friendly and, above all, so very polite.
    <p>A few weeks passed and Dick became 5 years old. On his birthday, he received an unexpected gift with a note saying'From your friend on the bus.' But there was no name or address
       so Dick couldn't write and thank him. Believe it or not, Dick recieved a present on his birthday from the same man every year until he was 18. When he left grammar school he recieved
       an expensive camera with the same words,'From your friend on the bus.'</p>
    <p>Then winter came and Dick's family had run out of coal so Dick contacted the Coal Company. Unfotunately, the coal supplies had run out and coal carts stopped running so there was no
       more coal to deliver. They repoted that Dick would have to wait till Monday morning. Dick was sadened by this because he knew he couldn't wait till Monday morning. But at the most
       desperate moments a beautiful car stoppped at their house and a chauffeur got down and brought some sacks loaded with coal. He was very happy and inquired who it was from. The cauffeur
       told him that there was a note in one of the sacks. Dick found the note and to his supprise, it was written 'From your friend on the bus.' The man on the the bus was the chairman of the
       Coal Company.</p>
    <p>All these kindness had come because a little boy had been polite years and years ago.</p>
